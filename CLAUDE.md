# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Home Assistant custom integration** for intelligent EV charging control. It manages EV charger automation based on solar production, time of day, battery levels, grid import protection, and intelligent priority balancing between EV and home battery charging.

**Domain:** `ev_smart_charger`
**Current Version:** 1.3.14
**Installation:** HACS custom repository or manual installation to `custom_components/ev_smart_charger`

## Development Commands

Since this is a Home Assistant custom integration, there are no build/test commands. Development workflow:

1. **Testing changes:**
   - Copy integration to Home Assistant instance: `cp -r custom_components/ev_smart_charger /path/to/homeassistant/custom_components/`
   - Restart Home Assistant
   - Check logs: Settings → System → Logs (search for "evsc")

2. **Enable debug logging** (add to `configuration.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.ev_smart_charger: debug
   ```

3. **Version updates:**
   - Update version in `custom_components/ev_smart_charger/manifest.json`
   - Update version in `custom_components/ev_smart_charger/const.py`
   - Update changelog in `README.md`
   - Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`
   - Tag release: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
   - Create GitHub Release with release notes

## Architecture (v1.0.0+)

### Major Architectural Changes (v1.0.0+)

The v1.0.0+ releases introduced complete refactoring with the following key changes:

1. **Dependency Injection Pattern**: All components receive dependencies via constructor
2. **Independent Priority Balancer**: Extracted from solar_surplus.py into standalone component
3. **Centralized ChargerController**: Single source of truth for all charger operations (v1.0.4+)
4. **Centralized Utilities**: New utils directory with logging, entity, and state helpers
5. **8-Phase Setup**: Sequential initialization with proper dependency ordering
6. **~50% Code Reduction**: Removed ~340 lines of duplicate charger control code

### Core Components

**Entry Point (`__init__.py`):**
- 8-phase setup process with dependency injection
- Creates helper entities via platform setup (Phase 1)
- **Creates ChargerController for centralized charger operations (Phase 2)**
- Initializes Automation Coordinator (Phase 3)
- Creates independent Priority Balancer (Phase 4)
- Creates Night Smart Charge with Balancer + Controller dependencies (Phase 5)
- Creates Smart Charger Blocker with Night Charge + Controller dependencies (Phase 6)
- Creates Solar Surplus with Balancer + Controller dependencies (Phase 7)
- Stores all component references (Phase 8)
- Waits 2 seconds after platform setup for entity registration

**Configuration Flow (`config_flow.py`):**
- 3-step wizard: Name → Charger Entities → Monitoring Sensors
- User maps existing HA entities to integration roles
- Options flow allows reconfiguration

### Helper Entities (Auto-Created)

The integration creates helper entities automatically via platform files:

**Switches (`switch.py`):**
- `evsc_forza_ricarica` - Global kill switch (disables all automations)
- `evsc_smart_charger_blocker_enabled` - Enable/disable Smart Charger Blocker
- `evsc_use_home_battery` - Enable/disable home battery support in Solar Surplus
- `evsc_priority_balancer_enabled` - Enable/disable Priority Balancer
- `evsc_night_smart_charge_enabled` - Enable/disable Night Smart Charge
- `evsc_car_ready_monday` through `evsc_car_ready_sunday` - Daily flags for night charge fallback/skip behavior (v1.3.13+)

**Numbers (`number.py`):**
- `evsc_check_interval` - Solar Surplus recalculation interval (1-60 min, default 1)
- `evsc_grid_import_threshold` - Max grid import (W) before reducing charge (default 50)
- `evsc_grid_import_delay` - Delay before acting on grid import (seconds, default 30)
- `evsc_surplus_drop_delay` - Delay before stopping charger on surplus drop (seconds, default 30)
- `evsc_home_battery_min_soc` - Minimum home battery SOC for battery support (%, default 20)
- `evsc_battery_support_amperage` - Amperage to use when battery support active (A, default 16)
- `evsc_night_charge_amperage` - Amperage for night charging (A, default 16)
- `evsc_min_solar_forecast_threshold` - Min PV forecast to skip night charge (kWh, default 20)
- Daily SOC targets (EV): `evsc_ev_min_soc_[monday-sunday]` (%, defaults 50 weekday, 80 weekend)
- Daily SOC targets (Home): `evsc_home_min_soc_[monday-sunday]` (%, default 50 all days)

**Selects (`select.py`):**
- `evsc_charging_profile` - Charging mode selector (manual, solar_surplus, charge_target, cheapest)

**Time (`time.py`):**
- `evsc_night_charge_time` - Time to start night charging (default 01:00:00)

**Sensors (`sensor.py`):**
- `evsc_diagnostic` - Comprehensive diagnostic sensor with all decision variables
- `evsc_priority_daily_state` - Priority Balancer state and target information
- `evsc_solar_surplus_diagnostic` - Solar Surplus detailed status

All helper entities use `RestoreEntity` to persist state across restarts.

### Component Details

#### 0. ChargerController (`charger_controller.py`) - **NEW in v1.0.4+**

**Purpose:** Centralized controller for ALL charger operations with rate limiting and queue management.

**Key Features:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All charger on/off/amperage operations go through this controller
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces 30-second minimum interval between operations
- **Operation Queue**: Manages multiple simultaneous requests with asyncio.Queue
- **Safe Amperage Sequences**:
  - Increase: Immediate (no delay needed)
  - Decrease: stop → 5 sec → set → 1 sec → start
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every operation logged with EVSCLogger
- **State Caching**: Tracks current amperage and on/off state

**Key Methods:**
- `start_charger(target_amps, reason)` - Start charger with specified amperage
- `stop_charger(reason)` - Stop charger with reason logging
- `set_amperage(target_amps, reason)` - Smart amperage change (auto-detects increase/decrease)
- `is_charging()` - Check current charger state
- `get_current_amperage()` - Get cached amperage value
- `get_queue_size()` - Monitor operation queue
- `get_seconds_since_last_operation()` - Rate limiting info

**Rate Limiting Logic:**
```python
if time_since_last_operation < 30 seconds:
    add_to_queue(operation)
    process_queue_when_allowed()
else:
    execute_immediately()
```

**Used By:** Solar Surplus, Night Smart Charge, Smart Charger Blocker

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates ~340 lines of duplicate code
- ✅ Prevents charger overflow errors (30-sec rate limit)
- ✅ Consistent logging across all operations
- ✅ Single place to fix/improve charger logic

#### 1. Priority Balancer (`priority_balancer.py`)

**Purpose:** Independent component managing EV vs Home battery charging prioritization based on daily SOC targets.

**States:**
- `PRIORITY_EV`: EV below target, prioritize EV charging
- `PRIORITY_HOME`: EV at/above target, Home battery below target
- `PRIORITY_EV_FREE`: Both targets met, opportunistic charging allowed

**Key Methods:**
- `async_setup()` - Discovers helper entities (enabled switch, daily SOC targets)
- `is_enabled()` - Check if Priority Balancer is enabled
- `async calculate_priority()` - Calculate current priority based on SOCs vs targets
- `get_current_priority()` - Get cached priority (use calculate_priority for fresh)
- `async is_ev_target_reached()` - Check if EV reached today's target (used by Night Charge)
- `async is_home_target_reached()` - Check if Home battery reached today's target
- `get_ev_target_for_today()` - Get EV target SOC for current day
- `get_home_target_for_today()` - Get Home battery target SOC for current day
- `async get_ev_current_soc()` - Get current EV SOC with validation
- `async get_home_current_soc()` - Get current Home battery SOC with validation

**Sensor Updates:**
Updates `evsc_priority_daily_state` sensor with:
- State: PRIORITY_EV / PRIORITY_HOME / PRIORITY_EV_FREE
- Attributes: balancer_enabled, today, current_ev_soc, target_ev_soc, current_home_soc, target_home_soc, reason, last_update

#### 2. Smart Charger Blocker (`automations.py`)

**Purpose:** Prevents charging during nighttime or when solar production is insufficient. Window adjusts based on Night Smart Charge state.

**Trigger:** Charger status changes to `charger_charging`

**Logic:**
1. Check if `evsc_forza_ricarica` is ON → allow charging (override)
2. Check if Night Smart Charge is active → allow charging (Night Charge takes priority)
3. Check if `evsc_smart_charger_blocker_enabled` is OFF → allow charging
4. Determine blocking window:
   - If Night Charge ENABLED: sunset → `evsc_night_charge_time`
   - If Night Charge DISABLED: sunset → sunrise
5. Check if current time in blocking window OR solar production below threshold
6. If blocked → turn off charger + send notification with retry logic

**Key Methods:**
- `_async_charger_status_changed()` - Event handler for charger status changes
- `_should_block_charging()` - Main decision logic with window calculation
- `_is_nighttime()` - Uses Home Assistant's astral events for sunset/sunrise
- `_is_solar_below_threshold()` - Compares sensor value to threshold
- `_block_charging()` - Uses ChargerController to stop charger + sends notification
- `_send_blocking_notification()` - Sends persistent notification

**Implementation Notes:**
- Uses `charger_controller.stop_charger()` for blocking (simplified from 130 lines to try-catch)
- 30-minute enforcement timeout to prevent log spam
- Rate limiting handled by ChargerController

#### 3. Night Smart Charge (`night_smart_charge.py`)

**Purpose:** Intelligent overnight charging from grid or home battery based on next day's PV forecast.

**Modes:**
- `battery`: Charging from home battery (when forecast sufficient)
- `grid`: Charging from grid (when forecast insufficient or battery support disabled)
- `idle`: Not active

**Dependencies:**
- Uses `priority_balancer.is_ev_target_reached()` for stop conditions
- Uses `charger_controller` for start/stop operations
- Coordinates with Smart Blocker for timing window

**Logic:**
1. Check if enabled and current time >= `evsc_night_charge_time`
2. Check PV forecast vs threshold
3. If forecast sufficient AND `evsc_use_home_battery` ON → battery mode (with pre-check)
4. If forecast insufficient OR battery support OFF → grid mode
5. Monitor SOC targets via Priority Balancer
6. Stop when `priority_balancer.is_ev_target_reached()` returns true

**Battery Mode Pre-Check (v1.3.13+):**
- Before starting charger, validates home battery SOC
- If home SOC <= threshold:
  - Check car_ready flag for current day (Mon-Sun)
  - If car_ready = TRUE → Fallback to GRID MODE (ensures car ready in morning)
  - If car_ready = FALSE → SKIP charging (wait for solar surplus)
- Prevents 15-second discharge before monitor detects low battery

**Key Methods:**
- `async_setup()` - Sets up time-based trigger, discovers car_ready switches
- `_async_time_trigger()` - Triggered at configured night charge time
- `_start_battery_charge()` - Start battery mode with pre-check logic
- `_battery_mode_monitor()` - Monitor battery-based charging, check targets
- `_grid_mode_monitor()` - Monitor grid-based charging, check targets
- `_should_activate()` - Check activation conditions
- `_get_car_ready_for_today()` - Get car_ready flag for current weekday (v1.3.13+)
- `is_active()` - Public method to check if Night Charge is currently active
- **All charger operations delegated to ChargerController**

#### 4. Solar Surplus Automation (`solar_surplus.py`)

**Purpose:** Charge EV using excess solar energy, with optional home battery support when Priority Balancer indicates EV priority.

**Trigger:** Periodic timer (configurable interval via `evsc_check_interval`, default 1 minute)

**Dependencies:**
- Uses `priority_balancer.calculate_priority()` for decision making
- Uses `charger_controller` for ALL charger operations (start, stop, amperage changes)
- Fallback mode when Balancer disabled (surplus → EV directly)

**Logic:**
1. Check if `evsc_forza_ricarica` is ON → skip (override)
2. Check if profile is `solar_surplus` → skip if not
3. Check charger status is NOT `charger_free` → skip if unplugged
4. Calculate priority via Priority Balancer (if enabled)
5. If priority == `PRIORITY_HOME` → stop charger (home battery needs charging)
6. Calculate surplus: `Solar Production - Home Consumption`
7. Check grid import and apply delays
8. Calculate target amperage from surplus
9. Handle home battery support (if enabled and priority == `PRIORITY_EV`)
10. Adjust charging amperage

**Home Battery Support Logic (v1.0.2):**
- **Activation Conditions:**
  - `evsc_use_home_battery` is ON
  - Home battery SOC >= `evsc_home_battery_min_soc`
  - Priority Balancer priority == `PRIORITY_EV` (EV below target, home can help)
- **Deactivation Conditions:**
  - Priority != `PRIORITY_EV` (including `PRIORITY_EV_FREE` when both targets met)
  - Home battery SOC < min threshold
  - Switch disabled
- **Charging Logic:**
  - ALWAYS calculate from surplus first
  - If surplus >= 6A: Use surplus-based amperage (6-32A from levels)
  - If surplus < 6A AND battery support active: Use `evsc_battery_support_amperage` (default 16A)
  - If surplus < 6A AND battery support NOT active: Stop charging

**Rate Limiting:**
- Minimum 30 seconds between checks to prevent event loop blocking
- Warning logged if >10 checks per minute

**Key Methods:**
- `async_setup()` - Discovers helper entities, starts periodic timer
- `_async_periodic_check()` - Main logic loop (runs every X minutes)
- `_calculate_target_amperage()` - Converts surplus watts to amps, handles battery support fallback
- `_handle_home_battery_usage()` - Manages battery support activation/deactivation
- **All charger operations delegated to ChargerController** (no duplicate methods)

**European Standard:** Uses 230V for watt-to-amp conversion

**Amperage Calculation:**
```python
surplus_amps = surplus_watts / 230V
# Find closest level from: [6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 24, 32]
```

### Utility Modules (`utils/`)

#### `logging_helper.py`

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding a New Helper Entity

1. Add constant to `const.py`:
   ```python
   HELPER_NEW_FEATURE_SUFFIX = "evsc_new_feature"
   DEFAULT_NEW_FEATURE_VALUE = 100
   ```

2. Create entity in appropriate platform file (`switch.py`, `number.py`, `select.py`, or `time.py`):
   ```python
   entities.append(
       EVSCSwitch(  # or EVSCNumber, EVSCSelect, EVSCTime
           entry.entry_id,
           "evsc_new_feature",
           "EVSC New Feature",
           "mdi:icon-name",
       )
   )
   ```

3. Entity ID will be: `{platform}.ev_smart_charger_{entry_id}_evsc_new_feature`

4. Discover in component using entity_helper:
   ```python
   from .utils import entity_helper

   entity = entity_helper.get_helper_entity(
       self.hass,
       HELPER_NEW_FEATURE_SUFFIX,
       "Component Name"
   )
   ```

### Adding a New Automation Component

1. Create new file in `custom_components/ev_smart_charger/`:
   ```python
   from .const import DOMAIN
   from .utils.logging_helper import EVSCLogger
   from .utils import entity_helper, state_helper

   class NewAutomation:
       def __init__(self, hass, entry_id, config, dependency=None):
           self.hass = hass
           self.entry_id = entry_id
           self.config = config
           self.dependency = dependency  # Optional dependency injection
           self.logger = EVSCLogger("NEW AUTOMATION")

       async def async_setup(self):
           """Setup: discover helper entities, register listeners."""
           self.logger.info("Setting up New Automation")
           # Discover entities using entity_helper
           # Register event listeners
           self.logger.success("Setup complete")

       async def async_remove(self):
           """Cleanup: remove listeners."""
           self.logger.info("Removing New Automation")
   ```

2. Register in `__init__.py` with proper phase:
   ```python
   # Determine phase based on dependencies
   new_automation = NewAutomation(hass, entry.entry_id, entry.data, dependency)
   await new_automation.async_setup()
   hass.data[DOMAIN][entry.entry_id]["new_automation"] = new_automation
   ```

3. Add unload in `async_unload_entry()`:
   ```python
   new_automation = entry_data.get("new_automation")
   if new_automation:
       await new_automation.async_remove()
   ```

### Using Dependency Injection

Components receive dependencies via constructor:

```python
# In __init__.py:
priority_balancer = PriorityBalancer(hass, entry.entry_id, entry.data)
await priority_balancer.async_setup()

night_smart_charge = NightSmartCharge(
    hass, entry.entry_id, entry.data,
    priority_balancer  # Dependency injection
)
await night_smart_charge.async_setup()

# In night_smart_charge.py:
class NightSmartCharge:
    def __init__(self, hass, entry_id, config, priority_balancer):
        self.priority_balancer = priority_balancer

    async def _battery_mode_monitor(self):
        # Use injected dependency
        if await self.priority_balancer.is_ev_target_reached():
            await self._stop_charging("EV target reached")
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear dependency graph
- Easy testing with mocks
- Single source of truth
- No circular dependencies

### Using EVSCLogger

```python
from .utils.logging_helper import EVSCLogger

class MyComponent:
    def __init__(self, hass, entry_id, config):
        self.logger = EVSCLogger("MY COMPONENT")

    async def some_method(self):
        self.logger.separator()
        self.logger.start("Important operation")
        self.logger.separator()

        # Log sensor values
        self.logger.sensor_value(f"{self.logger.SOLAR} Solar Production", 5000, "W")
        self.logger.sensor_value(f"{self.logger.HOME} Home Consumption", 2000, "W")

        # Log decision
        self.logger.decision(
            "Charging Decision",
            "Start charging at 16A",
            "Surplus of 3000W available"
        )

        # Log action
        self.logger.action("Starting charger", "Setting 16A")

        self.logger.success("Operation completed")
```

### Using Entity Helper

```python
from .utils import entity_helper

class MyComponent:
    async def async_setup(self):
        # Find entity by suffix
        self._enabled_entity = entity_helper.get_helper_entity(
            self.hass,
            "evsc_my_feature_enabled",
            "My Component"
        )

        # Check if switch is on
        if entity_helper.is_entity_on(self.hass, self._enabled_entity):
            # Do something
            pass
```

### Using State Helper

```python
from .utils import state_helper

class MyComponent:
    async def get_sensor_data(self):
        # Get float with default
        solar_watts = state_helper.get_float(
            self.hass,
            self._solar_sensor,
            default=0.0
        )

        # Get int with default
        soc = state_helper.get_int(
            self.hass,
            self._soc_sensor,
            default=0
        )

        # Get boolean
        is_enabled = state_helper.get_bool(
            self.hass,
            self._switch_entity,
            default=False
        )

        # Validate sensor before critical operations
        is_valid, error_msg = state_helper.validate_sensor(
            self.hass,
            self._critical_sensor,
            "Critical Sensor Name"
        )

        if not is_valid:
            self.logger.error(error_msg)
            return
```

### Accessing User-Configured Entities

Always get from config:
```python
charger_switch = self.config.get(CONF_EV_CHARGER_SWITCH)
charger_state = self.hass.states.get(charger_switch)
```

### Calling Services

```python
# Turn on/off switch
await self.hass.services.async_call(
    "switch",
    "turn_on",  # or "turn_off"
    {"entity_id": self._charger_switch},
    blocking=True,
)

# Set number value
await self.hass.services.async_call(
    "number",
    "set_value",
    {"entity_id": self._charger_current, "value": 16},
    blocking=True,
)

# With timeout
import async_timeout

async with async_timeout.timeout(SERVICE_CALL_TIMEOUT):
    await self.hass.services.async_call(...)
```

### Safe Amperage Adjustment Sequence

**For decreasing amperage:**
```python
async def _adjust_amperage_down(self, target_amperage: int):
    """Safe sequence to decrease amperage."""
    # 1. Stop charger
    await self._stop_charger("Reducing amperage")

    # 2. Wait for charger to stop
    await asyncio.sleep(CHARGER_STOP_SEQUENCE_DELAY)

    # 3. Set new amperage
    await self.hass.services.async_call(
        "number",
        "set_value",
        {"entity_id": self._charger_current, "value": target_amperage},
        blocking=True,
    )

    # 4. Wait for stabilization
    await asyncio.sleep(CHARGER_AMPERAGE_STABILIZATION_DELAY)

    # 5. Start charger
    await self._start_charger()
```

**For increasing amperage:**
```python
async def _set_amperage(self, target_amperage: int):
    """Direct amperage increase (safe without stopping)."""
    await self.hass.services.async_call(
        "number",
        "set_value",
        {"entity_id": self._charger_current, "value": target_amperage},
        blocking=True,
    )
```

## Important Notes

- **2-second delay:** After platform setup, wait 2 seconds for entity registration (`__init__.py:35`)
- **Blocking vs Non-Blocking:** Use `blocking=True` for critical service calls to ensure they complete
- **State Restoration:** All helper entities extend `RestoreEntity` to persist across restarts
- **Entity Naming:** Format is `{domain}.ev_smart_charger_{entry_id}_{suffix}`
- **Logging:** Use EVSCLogger with emoji prefixes for visual parsing
- **Grid Import:** Positive values = importing from grid, negative = exporting to grid
- **Safe Amperage Decrease:** Always use stop → wait → adjust → wait → start sequence to prevent charger issues
- **Safe Amperage Increase:** Can be done directly without stopping charger
- **Type Safety:** Use state_helper for all state reading with proper defaults
- **Entity Discovery:** Use entity_helper for consistent entity finding
- **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies via constructor, not by importing modules
- **Rate Limiting:** Solar Surplus enforces 30-second minimum between checks
- **Battery Support:** Only activates when Priority=EV (not EV_FREE, HOME, or disabled)
- **Smart Blocker Window:** Adjusts based on Night Smart Charge enabled state
- **Device Grouping:** All 29 helper entities are grouped under a single "EV Smart Charger" device (v1.3.8+). Each entity class has a `device_info` property that returns device identifiers, manufacturer, model, and sw_version. This enables proper organization in Home Assistant's device registry.
- **Rate Limiting & Logging:** Solar Surplus rate limit warning logs only once per minute to prevent log spam (v1.3.9+). Immediate recalculation triggers respect 30-second minimum check interval.
- **Charger Amperage Convention:** The charger does NOT support 0A. Valid levels are `CHARGER_AMP_LEVELS = [6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 24, 32]`. Internally, `target_amps = 0` is used as a convention to mean "STOP charger" (turn off), not "set to 0A". ChargerController translates: `0 → stop_charger()`, `>= 6 → start_charger(amps)` or `set_amperage(amps)`. Below 6A, the charger must be turned OFF.
- **Sensor Unavailability:** When amperage sensor returns None/unavailable (e.g., charger offline), `get_int(entity, default=None)` returns None without warnings (v1.3.7+). The system maintains current state until sensor becomes available again.

## Version History

### v1.3.15 (2025-11-05)
**Unified 60s Stability Delay for All Surplus Operations**
- **Change**: Initial charger start (OFF → ON) now uses same 60s delay as amperage increases
- **Rationale**: Consistent cloud protection for all surplus-based charging operations
- **Previous Behavior** (v1.3.14):
  - Charger OFF → ON: 15s stability delay
  - Charger ON, increase amperage: 60s stability delay
- **New Behavior** (v1.3.15):
  - Charger OFF → ON: **60s stability delay** (unified)
  - Charger ON, increase amperage: 60s stability delay (unchanged)
  - Charger ON, decrease amperage: 30s delay (unchanged)
- **User Impact**: More conservative charging start, prevents premature startup on brief surplus spikes
- **Technical**: Modified `solar_surplus.py` - `_handle_surplus_increase()` now uses `SURPLUS_INCREASE_DELAY` for both OFF→ON and increases
- **Upgrade priority**: 🟢 OPTIONAL - Further improves stability, especially for initial charge start

### v1.3.14 (2025-11-05)
**Cloud Protection for Surplus Increase**
- Added: 60-second stability delay before increasing charging amperage
- **Problem Fixed**: On cloudy days, system would immediately increase amperage when surplus briefly increased, then decrease 30s later when clouds returned
- **Old Behavior**:
  - Charger OFF → ON: 15s stability delay ✅
  - Charger ON, increase amperage: IMMEDIATE ❌ (caused oscillations)
  - Charger ON, decrease amperage: 30s delay ✅
- **New Behavior**:
  - Charger OFF → ON: 15s stability delay ✅
  - Charger ON, increase amperage: 60s stability delay ✅ (cloud protection)
  - Charger ON, decrease amperage: 30s delay ✅
- **Example Scenario Prevented**:
  ```
  ☁️ Cloud passes → surplus 3000W (13A) → wait 60s → if still stable, increase to 13A
  ☀️ Cloud arrives → surplus 1400W (6A)  → wait 30s → if still low, decrease to 6A
  ```
- **Technical**: Added `SURPLUS_INCREASE_DELAY = 60` constant in `const.py`
- **Modified**: `solar_surplus.py` - `_handle_surplus_increase()` now requires stability for all increases
- **User Impact**: More stable charging in variable weather, fewer charger state changes
- **Upgrade priority**: 🟢 OPTIONAL - Improves stability on cloudy days

### v1.3.13 (2025-11-05)
**Car Ready Flag & Battery Pre-Check**
- Added: Daily "Car Ready" flags for intelligent night charge fallback/skip behavior
- Added: Pre-check of home battery SOC before starting BATTERY MODE to prevent 15-second discharge
- **Problem Fixed**: When PV forecast good but home battery already below 20% threshold, system would start charging for 15 seconds before monitor detected issue
- **Enhancement**: User can now choose per-day behavior when battery insufficient:
  - Car ready = TRUE (Mon-Fri default): Use GRID MODE as fallback (ensures car ready in morning)
  - Car ready = FALSE (Sat-Sun default): SKIP charging (wait for solar surplus)
- **New Entities** (7 switches created automatically):
  - `switch.evsc_car_ready_monday` through `sunday`
  - Icon: `mdi:car-clock`
  - Defaults: Mon-Fri = TRUE (work days), Sat-Sun = FALSE (weekends)
- **Pre-Check Logic** in `_start_battery_charge()`:
  1. Check home battery SOC before starting charger
  2. If SOC <= threshold AND car_ready = TRUE → Fallback to GRID MODE
  3. If SOC <= threshold AND car_ready = FALSE → SKIP (wait for solar)
  4. If SOC > threshold → Proceed with BATTERY MODE normally
- **Helper Method**: `_get_car_ready_for_today()` returns boolean based on current weekday
- **Technical**: Modified `const.py` (constants), `switch.py` (7 switches), `night_smart_charge.py` (pre-check + helper), `logging_helper.py` (CAR emoji), `manifest.json` (version)
- **Upgrade priority**: 🟡 RECOMMENDED for users wanting flexible night charge behavior

### v1.3.12 (2025-11-05)
**CRITICAL FIX: Night Smart Charge Restart Loop & Battery Protection**
- Fixed FIVE critical bugs causing charger restart loops, inadequate battery protection, and excessive logging
- **Bug #1**: Periodic timer not cancelled after completion → restart loops
  - `_timer_unsub` was never cancelled in `_complete_night_charge()`
  - Periodic check continued running every minute after session completion
  - Led to re-evaluation and restart loops
- **Bug #2**: No cooldown protection in periodic check → race conditions
  - `_async_periodic_check()` had no protection against re-evaluating after recent completion
  - Created race condition: 01:00 start → 01:02 stop → 01:03 restart → 01:05 restart
  - Both Night Charge AND Solar Surplus tried to start charger simultaneously
- **Bug #3**: Battery monitoring too slow (1 minute) → failed protection
  - Battery dropped 8% (20% → 12%) between 1-minute checks
  - Slow monitoring failed to catch 20% threshold crossing in time
  - Solution: Reduced interval from 60s to 15s (4x faster, 75% response time improvement)
- **Bug #4**: Solar Surplus interference during cooldown
  - Solar Surplus had no awareness of Night Charge completion state
  - Attempted to start charger at 01:03 and 01:05 after Night Charge stopped
  - Created interference and restart loops
- **Bug #5**: No completion timestamp tracking
  - System had no memory of when sessions completed
  - Impossible to implement proper cooldown logic
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Added `_last_completion_time` attribute for timestamp tracking
  - Added `NIGHT_CHARGE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 3600` (1 hour) constant
  - Updated `_async_periodic_check()` with cooldown and active checks
  - Updated `_complete_night_charge()` to set completion timestamp
  - Reduced battery monitoring from 60s to 15s
  - Added Night Charge cooldown check in Solar Surplus (new step #4)
- **Impact**:
  - Battery protection at 20% threshold (not 12%)
  - No restart loops (1-hour cooldown enforced)
  - < 50 log messages per session (vs 200+)
  - Reliable battery protection and session management
- **Technical**: Modified `const.py`, `night_smart_charge.py`, `solar_surplus.py`
- **Upgrade priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL for users experiencing restart loops or battery protection failures

### v1.3.11 (2025-11-05)
**CRITICAL FIX: Solar Surplus Nighttime Operation**
- Fixed: Solar Surplus was running during nighttime and attempting to charge using home battery
- Root cause: Solar Surplus periodic check ran 24/7 without nighttime detection
- At 00:25 (nighttime): Surplus -492W → Priority EV → Battery support activated → 16A charging started
- Result: Smart Blocker had to intervene (should never happen)
- Solution: Added nighttime detection using `AstralTimeService.is_nighttime()`
- Solar Surplus now ONLY operates during daytime (sunrise → sunset)
- New check sequence: Forza Ricarica → **Nighttime** → Night Smart Charge → Profile → ...
- Nighttime hours fully protected: sunset → sunrise fully blocked for Solar Surplus
- Night Smart Charge handles ALL nighttime charging (starts at configured time, e.g., 01:00)
- Technical: Added AstralTimeService to solar_surplus.py, new check #2, renumbered sections
- Upgrade priority: 🔴 CRITICAL for users experiencing unwanted night charging

### v1.3.10 (2025-11-05)
**CRITICAL FIX: Smart Charger Blocker After Midnight**
- Fixed: Smart Charger Blocker was NOT blocking charging after midnight (e.g., at 00:11)
- Root cause: `AstralTimeService.get_blocking_window` used TODAY's sunset when checking times after midnight
- Example: At 00:11, compared with today's 18:30 (not yet occurred) instead of yesterday's 18:30 (passed)
- Result: `00:11 < 18:30` = false → blocker thought it was daytime → charger started incorrectly
- Solution: Check if reference_time is before sunrise:
  - Before sunrise (early morning): Use YESTERDAY's sunset as window_start
  - After sunrise (daytime/evening): Use TODAY's sunset as window_start
- Now at 00:11 with night_charge_time=01:00: `yesterday_18:30 <= 00:11 < today_01:00` = TRUE ✓
- Also simplified `is_in_blocking_window` logic (removed complex cross-day workaround)
- Technical: Modified `utils/astral_time_service.py` - `get_blocking_window` and `is_in_blocking_window`
- Upgrade priority: 🔴 CRITICAL for users relying on Smart Blocker for nighttime prevention

### v1.3.9 (2025-11-04)
**Logging Performance Fix**
- Fixed: "Module logging too frequently. 200 messages" warning in Home Assistant logs
- Root cause 1: Rate limit warning logged on every check (paradox)
- Root cause 2: Battery SOC monitor triggered immediate recalculation without rate limiting
- Solution 1: Rate limit warning now logs only once per minute (at cycle reset)
- Solution 2: Immediate recalculation respects SOLAR_SURPLUS_MIN_CHECK_INTERVAL (30s)
- Technical: Modified `solar_surplus.py` lines 253-257 (rate limit) and 223-241 (SOC monitor)

### v1.3.8 (2025-11-04)
**UI Improvements & Device Grouping**
- Added: `device_info` property to all entity classes (number, switch, select, time, sensor)
- Fixed: Config flow total_steps inconsistency (now correctly shows "Step X of 5")
- Result: All 29 entities now grouped under unified "EV Smart Charger" device
- Device info includes: manufacturer="antbald", model="EV Smart Charger", sw_version
- Icon "mdi:ev-station" already configured in manifest for HACS/device
- Daily SOC entities already have calendar icons (mdi:calendar-monday through sunday)
- Technical: Added VERSION import and device_info property to all platform files

### v1.3.7 (2025-11-04)
**Fix Unnecessary Warning Logs**
- Fixed: Eliminated false-positive warnings for unavailable amperage sensor (81+ occurrences)
- Root cause: `get_int()` was logging warning before checking state availability
- Solution: Reordered logic to check state FIRST, then convert
- Impact: Cleaner logs with only genuine errors, same functionality
- Technical: Modified `utils/state_helper.py` - `get_int()` function

### v1.3.6 (2025-11-04)
**Major Stability Improvements & Battery Protection**
- FASE 1: Anti-Oscillation System
  - Hysteresis implementation: start 6.5A, stop 5.5A, dead band 1.0A
  - EV_FREE mode stabilization: 30s delay instead of immediate stop
  - Startup stability: 15s stable surplus requirement
- FASE 2: Real-time Battery Protection
  - SOC listener on soc_home for immediate deactivation
  - Eliminates up to 1-minute protection delay
- FASE 3: Operation Result Feedback
  - OperationResult dataclass for comprehensive tracking
  - Enhanced ChargerController return types
- FASE 4: Code Cleanup
  - Removed dead code: async_setup_automations()
- Bugs Fixed: Charger oscillation, battery over-discharge, EV_FREE immediate stop

### v1.0.3 (2025-10-30)
**EV_FREE Mode Charging Logic Fix**
- Fixed: Charger now stops immediately in EV_FREE mode when surplus insufficient (< 6A)
- Old behavior: Waited 30 seconds (surplus drop delay) before stopping
- New behavior: Immediate stop - EV_FREE is opportunistic charging only
- Rationale: When both targets met, delays not needed (delays are for PRIORITY_EV fluctuations)
- Technical: Added immediate stop condition before surplus decrease delay logic

### v1.0.2 (2025-10-30)
**Battery Support Logic Refinement**
- Battery support now ONLY activates when Priority=EV (EV below target, home can help)
- Battery support NO LONGER activates when Priority=EV_FREE (both targets met)
- Preserves home battery energy when both systems already balanced
- Updated diagnostic sensor to reflect battery support activation conditions

### v1.0.1 (2025-10-30)
**Critical Bug Fixes**
- Fixed AttributeError in Smart Blocker: `is_night_charge_active()` → `is_active()`
- Fixed battery support logic: ALWAYS calculate from surplus first, only use battery when surplus < 6A
- Battery support now acts as fallback, not primary charging method
- Prevents battery support from limiting charging when abundant surplus available

### v1.0.0 (2025-10-30)
**Major Refactoring - Architecture Overhaul**

**New Components:**
- `priority_balancer.py` - Independent Priority Balancer component

## Debugging

### Common Issues

**Helper entities don't appear:**
1. Check platform registration in `const.py` PLATFORMS list
2. Verify `async_add_entities()` is called in platform files
3. Look for entity creation logs (search for "Created X EVSC")
4. Check entity registry: Developer Tools → States (search for "evsc")
5. Entity IDs contain entry_id, find via: `hass.states.async_entity_ids()`

**Component not initializing:**
1. Check logs for setup phase failures
2. Verify dependencies are passed correctly in `__init__.py`
3. Check entity discovery in `async_setup()` methods
4. Validate user-configured entities exist

**Battery support not activating:**
1. Check `evsc_use_home_battery` is ON
2. Check home battery SOC >= `evsc_home_battery_min_soc`
3. Check Priority Balancer priority == `PRIORITY_EV`
4. Check diagnostic sensor for activation conditions

**Smart Blocker not blocking:**
1. Check `evsc_smart_charger_blocker_enabled` is ON
2. Check Night Smart Charge is not active (takes priority)
3. Check current time vs blocking window
4. Check solar production vs threshold
5. Review Smart Blocker logs for decision reasoning

**Night Smart Charge not starting:**
1. Check `evsc_night_smart_charge_enabled` is ON
2. Check current time >= `evsc_night_charge_time`
3. Check PV forecast sensor is available
4. Check EV target not already reached
5. Review Night Smart Charge logs for activation conditions

**Solar Surplus not adjusting amperage:**
1. Check `evsc_charging_profile` is set to "solar_surplus"
2. Check charger status is not "charger_free"
3. Check Priority Balancer priority (PRIORITY_HOME stops charging)
4. Check surplus calculation (solar - home consumption)
5. Review Solar Surplus diagnostic sensor for detailed status

### Log Analysis

**Search patterns:**
- Component logs: Search for component name in brackets (e.g., "[SOLAR SURPLUS]")
- Decisions: Search for "🎯" emoji
- Actions: Search for "⚡" emoji
- Errors: Search for "❌" or "ERROR"
- Setup: Search for "Setting up" or "setup complete"

**Key log locations:**
- Setup phases: Search for "Phase 1", "Phase 2", etc. in `__init__.py`
- Priority calculations: Search for "Priority calculation" in Priority Balancer logs
- Battery support: Search for "Battery support" in Solar Surplus logs
- Blocking decisions: Search for "Blocking decision" in Smart Blocker logs
